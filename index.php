<h2 align=center>A High Performance Message Passing Library</h2>

<p> The Open MPI Project is an open source <?php
print("<a href=\"http://www.mpi-forum.org/\">"); ?>Message Passing Interface</a>
implementation that is developed and maintained by a consortium of
academic, research, and industry partners.  Open MPI is therefore able
to combine the expertise, technologies, and resources from all across
the High Performance Computing community in order to build the best
MPI library available.  Open MPI offers advantages for system and
software vendors, application developers and computer science
researchers.

<p>Features implemented or in short-term development for Open MPI
include:</p>
