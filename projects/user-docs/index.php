needs a leader.</strong></font></p>

<p>  Very little has happened on this sub-project because
of lack of interest / leadership.  <strong>Can you help?</strong></p>
</div>

<hr>

<p>The goal of this sub-project
is to provide a complete set of user-level documentation for the
Open MPI software package (i.e., more than this the FAQ and this web
site).  This documentation is primarily developed by the community for
the community.</p>

<p>This page is currently more of a placeholder than anything else,
but does contain a few useful links:</p>

<p>
<ul>

<li> Open MPI is a widely-used software package, and therefore must be
very careful about the intellectual properly it contains.  If you wish
to contribute documentation to the project, you must submit an <a
href="<?php print($topdir); ?>/community/contribute/">Open MPI 3rd
Party Contribution Form</a>.</li>

<li> <a
href="http://www.open-mpi.org/mailman/listinfo.cgi/docs">Subscribe or
unsubscribe</a> to the "ompi-docs" mailing list, where discussions
about the user documentation project take place.</li>

<li> See the <a href="http://www.open-mpi.org/community/lists/docs/">archives of the "ompi-docs" mailing list</a>.</li>
