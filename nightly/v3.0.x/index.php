<h2>These are not stable releases of software packages!</h2>

<p>Users looking for stable releases should <a href="<?php

<p>Note that snapshots are only generated when there has been a commit to
the v3.0.x branch in the Git ompi repository.  This may be less than once a day!</p>

<p>Tarballs are made from the Git v3.0.x branch nightly at approximately
9pm US Eastern time.</p>
