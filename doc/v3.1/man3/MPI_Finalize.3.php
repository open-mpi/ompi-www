<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Description</a></h2>
This
routine cleans up all MPI states. Once this routine is called, no MPI routine
(not even <a href="../man3/MPI_Init.3.php">MPI_Init</a>) may be called, except for <a href="../man3/MPI_Get_version.3.php">MPI_Get_version</a>, <a href="../man3/MPI_Initialized.3.php">MPI_Initialized</a>,
and <a href="../man3/MPI_Finalized.3.php">MPI_Finalized</a>. Unless there has been a call to <a href="../man3/MPI_Abort.3.php">MPI_Abort</a>, you must ensure
that all pending communications involving a process are complete before
the process calls MPI_Finalize. If the call returns, each process may either
continue local computations or exit without participating in further communication
with other processes. At the moment when the last process calls MPI_Finalize,
all pending sends must be matched by a receive, and all pending receives
must be matched by a send.
<p> MPI_Finalize is collective over all connected
processes. If no processes were spawned, accepted, or connected, then this
means it is collective over MPI_COMM_WORLD. Otherwise, it is collective
over the union of all processes that have been and continue to be connected.

<p>
<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Notes</a></h2>
All processes must call this routine before exiting. All processes
will still exist but may not make any further MPI calls. MPI_Finalize guarantees
that all local actions required by communications the user has completed
will, in fact, occur before it returns. However, MPI_Finalize guarantees
nothing about pending communications that have <i>not</i> been completed; completion
is ensured only by <a href="../man3/MPI_Wait.3.php">MPI_Wait</a>, <a href="../man3/MPI_Test.3.php">MPI_Test</a>, or <a href="../man3/MPI_Request_free.3.php">MPI_Request_free</a> combined with
some other verification of completion. <p>
For example, a successful return
from a blocking communication operation or from <a href="../man3/MPI_Wait.3.php">MPI_Wait</a> or <a href="../man3/MPI_Test.3.php">MPI_Test</a> means
that the communication is completed by the user and the buffer can be reused,
but does not guarantee that the local process has no more work to do. Similarly,
a successful return from <a href="../man3/MPI_Request_free.3.php">MPI_Request_free</a> with a request handle generated
by an <a href="../man3/MPI_Isend.3.php">MPI_Isend</a> nullifies the handle but does not guarantee that the operation
has completed. The <a href="../man3/MPI_Isend.3.php">MPI_Isend</a> is complete only when a matching receive has
completed. <p>
If you would like to cause actions to happen when a process finishes,
attach an attribute to MPI_COMM_SELF with a callback function. Then, when
MPI_Finalize is called, it will first execute the equivalent of an <a href="../man3/MPI_Comm_free.3.php">MPI_Comm_free</a>
on MPI_COMM_SELF. This will cause the delete callback function to be executed
on all keys associated with MPI_COMM_SELF in an arbitrary order. If no key
has been attached to MPI_COMM_SELF, then no callback is invoked. This freeing
of MPI_COMM_SELF happens before any other parts of MPI are affected. Calling
<a href="../man3/MPI_Finalized.3.php">MPI_Finalized</a> will thus return "false" in any of these callback functions.
Once you have done this with MPI_COMM_SELF, the results of MPI_Finalize
are not specified.
<p>
<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Errors</a></h2>
Almost all MPI routines return an error value;
C routines as the value of the function and Fortran routines in the last
argument. C++ functions do not return errors. If the default error handler
is set to MPI::ERRORS_THROW_EXCEPTIONS, then on error the C++ exception
mechanism will be used to throw an MPI::Exception object. <p>
Before the error
value is returned, the current MPI error handler is called. By default,
this error handler aborts the MPI job, except for I/O function errors. The
error handler may be changed with <a href="../man3/MPI_Comm_set_errhandler.3.php">MPI_Comm_set_errhandler</a>; the predefined
error handler MPI_ERRORS_RETURN may be used to cause error values to be
returned. Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue
past an error.
