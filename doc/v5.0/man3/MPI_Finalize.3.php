<h2><a name='sect6' href='#toc6'>Description</a></h2>
<p>
This routine cleans up all MPI states. Once this routine is called,
no MPI routine (not even C]MPI_InitR]) may be called, except for C]MPI_Get_versionR],
C]MPI_InitializedR], and C]MPI_FinalizedR]. Unless there has been a call
to C]MPI_AbortR], you must ensure that all pending communications involving
a process are complete before the process calls C]MPI_FinalizeR]. If the
call returns, each process may either continue local computations or exit
without participating in further communication with other processes. At
the moment when the last process calls C]MPI_FinalizeR], all pending sends
must be matched by a receive, and all pending receives must be matched
by a send. <p>
C]MPI_FinalizeR] is collective over all connected processes. If
no processes were spawned, accepted, or connected, then this means it is
collective over C]MPI_COMM_WORLDR]. Otherwise, it is collective over the
union of all processes that have been and continue to be connected.
<h2><a name='sect7' href='#toc7'>Notes</a></h2>
<p>
All
processes must call this routine before exiting. All processes will still
exist but may not make any further MPI calls. C]MPI_FinalizeR] guarantees
that all local actions required by communications the user has completed
will, in fact, occur before it returns. However, C]MPI_FinalizeR] guarantees
nothing about pending communications that have not been completed; completion
is ensured only by C]MPI_WaitR], C]<a href="../man3/MPI_Test.3.php">MPI_Test</a>,R] or C]MPI_Request_freeR]
combined with some other verification of completion. <p>
For example, a successful
return from a blocking communication operation or from C]MPI_WaitR] or
C]MPI_TestR] means that the communication is completed by the user and
the buffer can be reused, but does not guarantee that the local process
has no more work to do. Similarly, a successful return from C]MPI_Request_freeR]
with a request handle generated by an C]MPI_IsendR] nullifies the handle
but does not guarantee that the operation has completed. The C]MPI_IsendR]
is complete only when a matching receive has completed. <p>
If you would like
to cause actions to happen when a process finishes, attach an attribute
to C]MPI_COMM_SELFR] with a callback function. Then, when C]MPI_FinalizeR]
is called, it will first execute the equivalent of an C]MPI_Comm_freeR]
on C]MPI_COMM_SELFR]. This will cause the delete callback function to be
executed on all keys associated with C]MPI_COMM_SELFR] in an arbitrary
order. If no key has been attached to C]MPI_COMM_SELFR], then no callback
is invoked. This freeing of C]MPI_COMM_SELFR] happens before any other parts
of MPI are affected. Calling C]MPI_FinalizedR] will thus return [lq]false[rq]
in any of these callback functions. Once you have done this with C]MPI_COMM_SELFR],
the results of C]MPI_FinalizeR] are not specified.
<h2><a name='sect8' href='#toc8'>Errors</a></h2>
<p>
Almost all MPI
routines return an error value; C routines as the value of the function
and Fortran routines in the last argument. <p>
Before the error value is returned,
the current MPI error handler is called. By default, this error handler
aborts the MPI job, except for I/O function errors. The error handler may
be changed with C]MPI_Comm_set_errhandlerR]; the predefined error handler
C]MPI_ERRORS_RETURNR] may be used to cause error values to be returned.
Note that MPI does not guarantee that an MPI program can continue past
an error.
