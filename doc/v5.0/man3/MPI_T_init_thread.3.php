MPI_T_init_thread - Initializes the MPI Tool information interface
.SH SYNTAX
.SS C Syntax
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
#include <mpi.h>
int MPI_T_init_thread(int required, int *provided)
\f[R]
.fi
.SH INPUT PARAMETERS
.IP \[bu] 2
required: Desired level of thread support (integer).
.SH OUTPUT PARAMETERS
.IP \[bu] 2
provided: Available level of thread support (integer).
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[C]MPI_T_init_thread()\f[R] initializes the MPI tool information
interface.
Calls to MPI tool functions are allowed at any point in execution
(including before \f[C]MPI_Init()\f[R] and after
\f[C]MPI_Finalize()\f[R]) as long as \f[C]MPI_T_init_thread()\f[R] has
been called at least once and the number of calls to
\f[C]MPI_T_init_thread()\f[R] is greater than the number of calls to
\f[C]MPI_T_finalize()\f[R].
If at any point in execution the number of calls to
\f[C]MPI_T_finalize()\f[R] equals the number of calls to
\f[C]MPI_T_init_thread()\f[R] the MPI tool interface will no longer be
available until another call to \f[C]MPI_T_init_thread()\f[R].
.PP
\f[C]MPI_T_init_thread()\f[R], like \f[C]MPI_Init_thread()\f[R], has a
provision to request a certain level of thread support in
\f[C]required\f[R]:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]MPI_THREAD_SINGLE\f[R]: Only one thread will execute.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]MPI_THREAD_FUNNELED\f[R]: If the process is multithreaded, only the
thread that called \f[C]MPI_Init_thread()\f[R] will make MPI calls.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]MPI_THREAD_SERIALIZED\f[R]: If the process is multithreaded, only
one thread will make MPI library calls at one time.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE\f[R]: If the process is multithreaded, multiple
threads may call MPI at once with no restrictions.
.PP
The level of thread support available to the program is set in
\f[C]provided\f[R].
In Open MPI, the value is dependent on how the library was configured
and built.
Note that there is no guarantee that \f[C]provided\f[R] will be greater
than or equal to \f[C]required\f[R].
.SH NOTES
.PP
It is the caller\[cq]s responsibility to check the value of
\f[C]provided\f[R], as it may be less than what was requested in
\f[C]required\f[R].
.SH ERRORS
.PP
\f[C]MPI_T_init_thread()\f[R] will fail if:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]MPI_T_ERR_MEMORY\f[R]: Out of memory
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[C]MPI_T_ERR_CANNOT_INIT\f[R]: Interface not in the state to be
initialized
