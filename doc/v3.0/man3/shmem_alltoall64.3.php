<h2><a name='sect2' href='#toc2'>Description</a></h2>

<p> <p>
The shmem_alltoalls routines are collective routines. Each
PE in the Active set exchanges nelems strided data elements of size 32
bits (for shmem_alltoalls32) or 64 bits (for shmem_alltoalls64) with all
other PEs in the set. Both strides, dst and sst, must be greater than or
equal to 1. The sst*jth block sent from PE i to PE j is placed in the dst*ith
block of the dest data object on PE j. As with all OpenSHMEM collective
routines, these routines assume that only PEs in the Active set call the
routine. If a PE not in the Active set calls an OpenSHMEM collective routine,
undefined behavior results. The values of arguments dst, sst, nelems, PE_start,
logPE_stride, and PE_size must be equal on all PEs in the Active set. The
same dest and source data objects, and the same pSync work array must be
passed to all PEs in the Active set. Before any PE calls to a shmem_alltoalls
routine, the following conditions must exist (synchronization via a barrier
or some other method is often needed to ensure this): The pSync array on
all PEs in the Active set is not still in use from a prior call to a shmem_alltoalls
routine. The dest data object on all PEs in the Active set is ready to accept
the shmem_alltoalls data. Upon return from a shmem_alltoalls routine, the
following is true for the local PE: Its dest symmetric data object is completely
updated and the data has been copied out of the source data object. The
values in the pSync array are restored to the original values. <p>
The arguments
are as follows:
<dl>

<dt>A symmetric data object with one of the following data
types: </dt>
<dd><blockquote></dd>

<dt><b>shmem_alltoall32</b>: Any noncharacter type that </dt>
<dd>has an element size
of 32 bits. No Fortran derived types or C/C++ structures are allowed. </dd>

<dt><b>shmem_alltoall64</b>:
Any noncharacter type that has an element size </dt>
<dd>of 64 bits. No Fortran derived
types or C/C++ structures are allowed. </dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>
</blockquote>
target A symmetric data object large
enough to receive the combined total of nelems elements from each PE in
the Active set.
<dl>

<dt>source </dt>
<dd>A symmetric data object that contains nelems elements
of data for each PE in the Active set, ordered according to destination
PE. </dd>

<dt>dst </dt>
<dd>The stride between consecutive elements of the dest data object.
The stride is scaled by the element size. A value of 1 indicates contiguous
data. dst must be of type ptrdiff_t. If you are using Fortran, it must be
a default integer value. </dd>

<dt>sst </dt>
<dd>The stride between consecutive elements of
the source data object. The stride is scaled by the element size. A value
of 1 indicates contiguous data. sst must be of type ptrdiff_t. If you are
using Fortran, it must be a default integer value. </dd>

<dt>nelems </dt>
<dd>The number of
elements to exchange for each PE. nelems must be of type size_t for C/C++.
If you are using Fortran, it must be a default integer value </dd>

<dt>PE_start </dt>
<dd>The
lowest virtual PE number of the active set of PEs. PE_start must be of type
integer. If you are using Fortran, it must be a default integer value. </dd>

<dt>logPE_stride
</dt>
<dd>The log (base 2) of the stride between consecutive virtual PE numbers in
the active set. log_PE_stride must be of type integer. If you are using Fortran,
it must be a default integer value. </dd>

<dt>PE_size </dt>
<dd>The number of PEs in the active
set. PE_size must be of type integer. If you are using Fortran, it must be
a default integer value. </dd>
</dl>
<p>

<dl>

<dt>pSync </dt>
<dd>A symmetric work array. In C/C++, pSync must
be of type long and size _SHMEM_ALLTOALL_SYNC_SIZE. In Fortran, pSync must
be of type integer and size SHMEM_ALLTOALL_SYNC_SIZE. Every element of this
array must be initialized with the value _SHMEM_SYNC_VALUE (in C/C++) or
SHMEM_SYNC_VALUE (in Fortran) before any of the PEs in the active set enter
shmem_barrier(). </dd>
</dl>
<p>
Upon return from a shmem_alltoalls routine, the following
is true for the local PE: Its dest symmetric data object is completely
updated and the data has been copied out of the source  data object. The
values in the pSync array are restored to the original values. <p>
The values
of arguments PE_root, PE_start, logPE_stride, and PE_size must be equal
on all PEs in the active set. The same target and source data objects and
the same pSync work array must be passed to all PEs in the active set. <p>
Before
any PE calls a alltoall routine, you must ensure that the following conditions
exist (synchronization via a barrier or some other method is often needed
to ensure this): The pSync array on all PEs in the active set is not still
in use from a prior call to a alltoall routine. The target array on all
PEs in the active set is ready to accept the alltoall data.
<h2><a name='sect3' href='#toc3'>Notes</a></h2>

<p> The terms
collective and symmetric are defined in <i><i>intro_shmem</i>(3)</i>. <p>
All SHMEM alltoall
routines restore pSync to its original contents. Multiple calls to SHMEM
routines that use the same pSync array do not require that pSync be reinitialized
after the first call. <p>
You must ensure the that the pSync array is not being
updated by any PE in the active set while any of the PEs participates in
processing of a SHMEM broadcast routine. Be careful to avoid these situations:
If the pSync array is initialized at run time, some type of synchronization
is needed to ensure that all PEs in the working set have initialized pSync
before any of them enter a SHMEM routine called with the pSync synchronization
array. A pSync array may be reused on a subsequent SHMEM broadcast routine
only if none of the PEs in the active set are still processing a prior
SHMEM alltoall routine call that used the same pSync array. In general,
this can be ensured only by doing some type of synchronization. However,
in the special case of SHMEM routines being called with the same active
set, you can allocate two pSync arrays and alternate between them on successive
calls. <p>
