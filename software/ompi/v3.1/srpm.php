<p>Because every parallel computation environment is different, Open MPI
is a highly configurable piece of software.  As such, a single set of
build options is not sufficient to meet everyone's needs.  The source
RPM therefore accepts a wide variety of configuration options on the
"<code>rpmbuild --rebuild</code>" command line.  The following text
describes the options that are available.</p>

<p>A script to build an Open MPI RPM from a source tarball <a
href="<?php print($build_script); ?>">is available here</a>, and is
referred to as "<code>buildrpm.sh</code>" in the text below.
Additionally, you can build an Open MPI RPM from the SRPM (also
described below).</p>

<p>The text below is specific to the <?php print($ver); ?> series of
Open MPI and <a href="<?php print($readme); ?>">is available here in a
printer-friendly format</a>.

<p>Note that the spec file (that the text below refers to) has many
more comments and explanations of rpmbuild-time configuration options,
and <a href="<?php print($specfile); ?>">is available here</a>.
