<li> *v1.7 and later series:* The [plm_rsh_agent] MCA parameter
accepts a colon-delimited list of programs to search for in your path
to use as the remote startup agent.  The default value
is \"ssh : rsh\", meaning that it will look for [ssh] first, and if it
doesn't find it, use [rsh].  You can change the value of this
parameter as relevant to your environment, such as simply changing it
to [rsh] or [rsh : ssh] if you have a mixture. The deprecated forms
[pls_rsh_agent] and [orte_rsh_agent] will also work.</li>

<li> *v1.3 to v1.6 series:* The [orte_rsh_agent] MCA parameter
accepts a colon-delimited list of programs to search for in your path
to use as the remote startup agent (the MCA parameter name
[plm_rsh_agent] also works, but it is deprecated).  The default value
is \"ssh : rsh\", meaning that it will look for [ssh] first, and if it
doesn't find it, use [rsh].  You can change the value of this
parameter as relevant to your environment, such as simply changing it
to [rsh] or [rsh : ssh] if you have a mixture.</li>

<li> *v1.1 and v1.2 series:* The v1.1 and v1.2 method is exactly the
same as the v1.3 method, but the MCA parameter name is slightly
different: [pls_rsh_agent] (\"pls\" vs. \"plm\").  Using the old
\"pls\" name will continue to work in the v1.3 series, but it is now
officially deprecated -- you'll receive a warning if you use it.</li>

<li> *v1.0 series:* In the 1.0.x series, Open MPI defaults to using
[ssh] for remote startup of processes in unscheduled environments.
You can change this to [rsh] by <a

parameter</a> [pls_rsh_agent] to [rsh].  </li>

There are multiple ways.

Note that there are multiple versions of [ssh] available.  References
to [ssh] in this text refer to OpenSSH.

This documentation provides an _overview_ for using user keys and the
OpenSSH 2.x key management agent (if your OpenSSH only supports 1.x
key management, you should upgrade).  See the OpenSSH documentation
for more details and a more thorough description.  The process is
essentially the same for other versions of SSH, but the command names
and filenames may be slightly different.  Consult your SSH
documentation for more details.

Normally, when you use [ssh] to connect to a remote host, it will
prompt you for your password. However, the easiest way for [mpirun]
(and [mpiexec], which, in Open MPI, is identical to [mpirun]) to work
properly, you need to be able to execute jobs on remote nodes without
typing in a password. In order to do this, you will need to set up
passphrase We recomend using RSA passphrases as they is generally
\"better\" (i.e., more secure) than DSA passphrases.  As such, this
text will describe the process for RSA setup.

<font color=\"red\"><strong>NOTE:</strong></font> This text will briefly
show you the steps involved in doing this, but the [ssh] documentation
is authorative on these matters should be consulted for more
information.

The first thing that you need to do is generate an RSA key pair to use
with [ssh-keygen]:

<geshi bash>
shell$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
</geshi>

Accept the default value for the file in which to store the key
([\$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa]) and enter a passphrase for your key pair.  You
may choose to not enter a passphrase and therefore obviate the need
for using the [ssh-agent].  However, this <strong>greatly</strong>
weakens the authentication that is possible, because your secret key
is [potentially] vulnerable to compromise because it is unencrypted.
It has been compared to the moral equivalent of leaving a plain text
copy of your password in your [\$HOME] directory.  See the [ssh]
documentation for more details.

Next, copy the [\$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub] file generated by [ssh-keygen]
to [\$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys] (or add it to the end of
[authorized_keys] if that file already exists):

<geshi bash>
shell$ cd \$HOME/.ssh
shell$ cp id_rsa.pub authorized_keys
</geshi>

In order for RSA authentication to work, you need to have the
[\$HOME/.ssh] directory in your home directory on all the machines you
are running Open MPI.  If your home directory is on a common
filesystem, this may be already taken care of.  If not, you will need to
copy the [\$HOME/.ssh] directory to your home directory on all Open
MPI nodes (be sure to do this in a secure manner -- perhaps using the
[scp] command -- particularly if your secret key is not encrypted).

[ssh] is very particular about file permissions. Ensure that your home
directory on all your machines is set to at least mode 755, your
[\$HOME/.ssh] directory is also set to at least mode 755, and that the
following files inside [\$HOME/.ssh] have at least the following
permissions:

<geshi text>
-rw-r--r--  authorized_keys
-rw-------  id_rsa
-rw-r--r--  id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r--  known_hosts
</geshi>

The phrase \"at least\" in the above paragraph means the following:
<ul>
<li> The files need to be readable by you</li>
<li> The files should _only_ be writable by you</li>
<li> The files should not be executable</li>
<li> Aside from [id_rsa], the files _can_ be readable by others, but
do not need to be</li>
<li> Your [\$HOME] and [\$HOME/.ssh] directories _can_ be readable by
others, but do not need to be</li>
</ul>

You are now set up to use RSA authentication. However, when you [ssh]
to a remote host, you will still be asked for your RSA _passphrase_
(as opposed to your normal _password_). This is where the [ssh-agent]
program comes in. It allows you to type in your RSA passphrase once,
and then have all successive invocations of [ssh] automatically
authenticate you against the remote host.  See the [ssh-agent(1)]
documentation for more details than what are provided here.

Additionally, check the documentation and setup of your local
environment; [ssh-agent] may already be setup for you (e.g., see if
the shell environment variable [\$SSH_AUTH_SOCK] exists; if so,
[ssh-agent] is likely already running).  If [ssh-agent] is not already
running, you can start it manually with the following:

<geshi bash>
shell$ eval `ssh-agent`
</geshi>

Note the specific invocation method: [ssh-agent] outputs some shell
commands to its output (e.g., setting the [SSH_AUTH_SOCK] environment
variable).

You will probably want to start the [ssh-agent] before you start your
graphics / windowing system so that all your windows will inherit the
environment variables set by this command.  Note that some sites
invoke [ssh-agent] for each user upon login automatically; be sure to
check and see if there is an [ssh-agent] running for you already.

Once the [ssh-agent] is running, you can tell it your passphrase by
running the [ssh-add] command:

<geshi bash>
shell$ ssh-add \$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa
</geshi>

At this point, if you [ssh] to a remote host that has the same
[\$HOME/.ssh] directory as your local one, you should not be prompted
for a password or passphrase.  If you are, a common problem is that
the permissions in your [\$HOME/.ssh] directory are not as they should
be.

Note that this text has covered the [ssh] commands in _very little
detail._ Please consult the [ssh] documentation for more information.";

$q[] = "What is a <code>.rhosts</code> file?  Do I need it?";

$anchor[] = "rhosts-file";

$a[] = "If you are using [rsh] to launch processes on remote nodes,
you will probably need to have a [\$HOME/.rhosts] file.

This file allows you to execute commands on remote nodes without being
prompted for a password.  The permissions on this file usually must be
0644 ([rw-r--r--]).  It must exist in your home directory on every
node that you plan to use Open MPI with.

Each line in the [.rhosts] file indicates a machine and user that
programs may be launched _from._  For example, if the user
[steve] wishes to launch programs from the machine [stevemachine] to
the machines [alpha], [beta], and [gamma], there must be a [.rhosts]
file on each of the three remote machines ([alpha], [beta], and
[gamma]) with at least the following line in it:

<geshi text>
stevemachine steve
</geshi>

The first field indicates the name of the machine where jobs may
originate from; the second field indicates the user ID who may
originate jobs from that machine.  It is better to supply a
fully-qualified domain name for the machine name (for security reasons
-- there may be many machines named [stevemachine] on the internet).
So the above example should be:

<geshi text>
stevemachine.example.com steve
</geshi>

<div align=\"center\"> *The Open MPI Team _strongly_ discourages the
use of \"[+]\" in the [.rhosts] file.  This is always a _huge_
security hole.* </div>

If [rsh] does not find a matching line in the [\$HOME/.rhosts] file, it
will prompt you for a password.  Open MPI requires the password-less
execution of commands; if [rsh] prompts for a password, [mpirun] will
fail.

<strong><font color=red>NOTE:</font></strong> Some implementations of
[rsh] are _very_ picky about the format of text in the [.rhosts] file.
In particular, some do not allow leading white space on each line in
the [.rhosts] file, and will give a misleading \"permission denied\"
error if you have white space before the machine name.

<strong><font color=red>NOTE:</font></strong> It should be noted that
[rsh] is _not_ considered \"secure\" or \"safe\" -- [.rhosts]
authentication is considered fairly weak.  The Open MPI Team
recommends that you use [ssh] (\"Secure Shell\") to launch remote
programs as it uses a much stronger authentication system.";

$a[] = "<font color=red size=+3><strong>No!</strong></font>

While there are _a very small number_ of cases where using \"[+]\" in
your [.rhosts] file may be acceptable, the Open MPI Team *highly*
recommends that you do not.

Using a \"[+]\" in your [.rhosts] file indicates that you will allow
any machine and/or any user to connect as you.  This is _extremely_
dangerous, especially on machines that are connected to the internet.
Consider the fact that anyone on the internet can connect to your
machine (as you) -- it should strike fear into your heart.

<center>
*The [+] should not be used for either field of the [.rhosts] file.*
</center>

Instead, you should use the full and proper hostname and username of
accounts that are authorized to remotely login as you to that machine
(or machines).  This is usually just a list of your own username on a
list of machines that you wish to run Open MPI with.  See <a
href=\"#rhosts-file\">this FAQ entry</a> for further details, as well
as your local [rsh] documentation.

Additionally, the Open MPI Team strongly recommends that [rsh] is not
used in unscheduled environments (espectially those connected to the
internet) -- it is considered weak remote authentication.  Instead, we
recommend the use of [ssh] -- the secure remote shell.  See <a
href=\"#ssh-keys\">this FAQ entry</a> for more details.";
