Nope.. at the moment I am doing the lame stuff i.e. simply changing the tcp code. So I have not created another btl component. I know its not recommended thing, but I just wanted to try before committing. Apart from xensocket specific stuff, all what I have done inside the btl/tcp code is to change the structure<br><br><div>&nbsp;struct&nbsp; mca_btl_tcp_addr_t {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct in_addr addr_inet;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /**&lt; IPv4 address in network byte order */<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in_port_t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; addr_port;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /**&lt; listen port */<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unsigned short addr_inuse;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /**&lt; local meaning only */<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 xs_domU_ref;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; /**&lt;xs: domU memory reference&nbsp; */<br>};<br><br>I wanted this structure to be passed on to all peers through component exchange (modex send/recv).&nbsp; This way I have the normal socket listen port, its address and xensocket memory reference (its not complete as it is missing some other info, but lets stick to basic stuff). <br><br>The second question is regarding btl tcp recv. I have seen a couple of emails with some explanation specific to that particular user but cannot seem to answer this question (ref to previous email). <br><br></div>Best Regards,<br>Muhammad Atif<br><br>PS: I would love if you do some explanation of modex recv as well. ;)<br>Thanks for all the support you guys are giving.<br><div style="font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 10pt;"><br><br><div style="font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;">----- Original Message

Now I&nbsp; <br>&gt; have changed the struct mca_btl_tcp_addr_t present in btl_tcp_addr.h
&nbsp; <br>&gt; and have added int r_domu_id. This makes the size of structure 12.&nbsp; <br>&gt; Upon receive mca_btl_tcp_proc_create() gives an error after&nbsp; <br>&gt; mca_pml_base_modex_recv() and at this statement if(0 != (size %&nbsp; <br>&gt; sizeof(mca_btl_tcp_addr_t))) that size do not match.

In my&nbsp; <br>&gt; understanding, once Recv api is called, the control goes through PML
&nbsp; <br>&gt; layer and everything initializes there. However, I am unable to get&nbsp; <br>&gt; a lock at the layer/file/function where the receive socket polling&nbsp; <br>&gt; is done.

 partitioned<br>&gt; &gt; (normalized) our system with Xen and have seen that virtualization<br>&gt; &gt; overhead is not that great (for some applications) as compared to<br>&gt; &gt; potential benefits that we can get. We have executed various<br>&gt; &gt; benchmarks on different network/cluster configuration of Xen and<br>&gt; &gt; Native linux and they are really encouraging. The only known
 problem<br>&gt; &gt; is inter-domain communication of Xen which is quite poor (1/6 of
 the<br>&gt; &gt; native memory transfer and not to mention 50%CPU utilization of<br>&gt; &gt; host). We have tested out Xensocket, and these sockets give us<br>&gt; &gt; really good performance boost in all respects.<br>&gt; &gt; Now that I am having a look at the complex yet wonderful<br>&gt; &gt; architecture of openmpi, can you guys give me some guidance on<br>&gt; &gt; couple of naive questions?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; 1- How do I view the console output of an mpi process which is not<br>&gt; &gt; at headnode? Do I have to have some parallel debugger? Or is there<br>&gt; &gt; any magical technique?<br>&gt;<br>&gt; OMPI's run-time environment takes care of redirection stdout/stderr<br>&gt; from each MPI process to the stdout/stderr of mpirun for you (this is<br>&gt; another use of the "out of band" TCP channel that is setup between<br>&gt; mpirun and all the MPI processes).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; 2- How do i setup GPR?<br>&gt;<br>&gt;
 You don't.&nbsp; The GPR is automatically instantiated in mpirun upon<br>&gt; startup.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; say i have a struct foo, and all processes have at least one such<br>&gt; &gt; instance of foo. From what I gather, openmpi will create a linked<br>&gt; &gt; list of foo's that were passed on (though I am unable to pass one<br>&gt; &gt; on). Where do i have to define struct foo so that it can be<br>&gt; &gt; exchanged b/w the processes? I know its a lame question, but I
 think<br>&gt; &gt; i am getting lost in the sea. :(<br>&gt;<br>&gt; I assume you're asking about the modex.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Every BTL defines its own data that is passed around in the modex.
&nbsp; It<br>&gt; is assumed that only modules of the same BTL type will be able to&nbsp; <br>&gt; read/<br>&gt; understand that data.&nbsp; The modex just treats the data as a blob; all<br>&gt; the modex blobs are gathered into mpirun and then broadcast out to<br>&gt; every MPI process (I said scatter in my previous mail; broadcast is<br>&gt; more accurate).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; So when you modex_send, you just pass a pointer to a chunk of memory<br>&gt; and a length (e.g., a pointer to a struct instance and a length).<br>&gt; When you modex_receive, you can just dereference the blob that you<br>&gt; return as the same struct type as you modex_send'ed previously<br>&gt; (because you can only receive blobs from BTL modules that are the
 same<br>&gt; type as you, and therefore the data they sent is the same type of
 data<br>&gt; that you sent).<br>&gt;<br>&gt; You can do more complex things in the modex if you need to, of<br>&gt; course.&nbsp; For example, we're changing the openib BTL to send variable<br>&gt; length data in the modex, but that requires a bit more setup and I<br>&gt; suspect you don't need to do this.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Best Regards,<br>&gt; &gt; Muhammad Atif<br>&gt; &gt; PS: I am totally new to MPI internals. So if at all we decide to go<br>&gt; &gt; ahead with the project, I would be regular bugger in the list.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; That's what we're here for.&nbsp; We don't always reply immediately, but
 we<br>&gt; try.&nbsp; :-)<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----<br>&gt; &gt; From: Adrian Knoth &lt;<a ymailto="mailto:adi@drcomp.erfurt.thur.de" href="mailto:adi@drcomp.erfurt.thur.de">adi@drcomp.erfurt.thur.de</a>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; To: Open MPI Developers &lt;<a ymailto="mailto:devel@open-mpi.org" href="mailto:devel@open-mpi.org">devel@open-mpi.org</a>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, January 10, 2008 1:24:01 AM<br>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [OMPI devel] btl tcp port to xensocket<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; On Tue, Jan 08, 2008 at 10:51:45PM -0800, Muhammad Atif wrote:<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am planning to port tcp component to xensocket, which is a fast<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; interdomain communication mechanism for guest domains in Xen.

 MPI&nbsp; <br>&gt; communication?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Wouldn't it be easier to leave the unpartitioned host alone and use<br>&gt; &gt; shared memory communication instead?<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; As per design, and the fact that these sockets are not normal<br>&gt; &gt; sockets,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; I have to pass certain information (basically memory references,<br>&gt; &gt; guest<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; domain info etc) to other peers once sockets have been created. I<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; There's ORTE, the runtime environment. It employs OOB/tcp to have&nbsp; <br>&gt; a so<br>&gt; &gt; called out-of-band channel. ORTE also provides a general purpose<br>&gt; &gt; registry (GPR).<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Once a TCP connection between the headnode process and all other&nbsp; <br>&gt; peers<br>&gt; &gt; is established, you can store your required information in the GPR.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; understand that mca_pml_base_modex_send and
 recv (or simply using<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; mca_btl_tcp_component_exchange) can be used to exchange&nbsp; <br>&gt; information,<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Use mca_pml_base_modex_send (now ompi_modex_send) and encode your<br>&gt; &gt; required information. It's getting stored in the GPR. Read it back<br>&gt; &gt; with<br>&gt; &gt; mca_pml_base_modex_recv (ompi_modex_recv), as it is done in<br>&gt; &gt; mca_btl_tcp_component_exchange and mca_btl_tcp_proc_create.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; but I cannot seem to get them to communicate. So to put my<br>&gt; &gt; question in<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; a very simple way..... I want to create a socket structure<br>&gt; &gt; containing<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; necessary information, and then pass it to all other peers before<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; start of actual mpi communication. What is the easiest way to do
&nbsp; <br>&gt; it.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; Quite the same way. mca_btl_tcp_component_exchange assembles the<br>&gt; &gt; required information and stores it in the GPR by calling<br>&gt; &gt; ompi_modex_send.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; mca_btl_tcp_proc_create (think of "the other peers") reads this<br>&gt; &gt; information into local context.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I guess you might want to copy btl/tcp to let's say btl/xen, so you<br>&gt; &gt; can<br>&gt; &gt; modify internal structures, if required. Perhaps xensockets don't&nbsp; <br>&gt; need<br>&gt; &gt; IP addresses, as they are actually memory sockets.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; However, you'll still need TCP communication between Xen guests for<br>&gt; &gt; the<br>&gt; &gt; OOB channel.<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; As mentioned above, I'm not sure if it's reasonable to use Xen and
&nbsp; <br>&gt; MPI<br>&gt; &gt; at all. Virtualization overhead might decrease your performance,
