Thanks for the extremely informative reply!<br>
I can appreciate the reasons for dropping of Windows support.&nbsp; The reason for wanting a Windows version of this scientific calculation software is to allow the non-programmerish end-users be able to run it 'out of the box' using precompiled Windows executables.<br>
I do not know much about Cygwin; I'll look into that and see what it can do for my situation.<br>
Good info to know about 'sm' and why it doesn't play well with MPI_Comm_spawn.<br>
<br>
I had wondered about recoding to _not_ use MPI_Comm_spawn, but (a) this works absolutely fabulously under Linux (both multi-core systems and clusters); and (b) any such changes would require significant changes to the architecture of the programs depending
 on it.&nbsp; Given this alternative, the licensing fee for the Intel MPI library may not be an obstacle anymore.<br>
A Linux VM on a Windows machine could be a possible solution, except that some of the end-users have their Windows boxes locked down tight, for security reasons.<br>
I also thought the TCP connection issue was odd; I got the same results on both my work and home Windows computers.&nbsp;

<br>
I think there were a few not-entirely-correct data points in this thread. Let me clarify a few things:<br>
<br>
1. Yes, Open MPI suspended native Windows support a while back. Native windows support is simply not a popular use case, and therefore we couldn't justify spending the time on it (not the mention the fact that no one in the community had enough Windows development
 experience to keep a native port alive and well-maintained).<br>
<br>
2. That being said, AFAIK, Open MPI still compiles and runs fine -- albeit with restrictions -- in a Cygwin environment on Windows. This was deemed &quot;good enough&quot; by the Open MPI community (especially given the points from #1). Recent binary versions of Open
 MPI are available courtesy of the Cygwin project: https://cygwin.com/cgi-bin2/package-grep.cgi?grep=openmpi.<br>
<br>
3. &quot;sm&quot; works fine with intercommunicators. What it doesn't do is handle the expansion of its shared memory allocation when new MPI processes are added via the dynamic APIs (e.g., MPI_COMM_SPAWN). We've talked about removing this restriction in &quot;vader&quot; (the
 next-gen version of the &quot;sm&quot; BTL -- yes, I know, the name is not intuitive at all...), but I don't think that this has been an important enough feature for anyone to spend time on it. As always, patches are welcome. ;-)<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
It's been pointed out, but Open MPI 1.6.5 is pretty ancient (it was released Jun of 2013). Per #2, you might want to try the latest stable release (e.g., via Cygwin binaries).<br>
<br>
There's two other options that may not have been mentioned yet:<br>
<br>
1. Re-code your application to not use the MPI dynamic APIs (e.g., MPI_COMM_SPAWN). I know this is not quite what you want to do, but given all the other restrictions and data points, it might be your least-sucky option.<br>
<br>
2. Run a VM on your Windows machine with some flavor of Linux. That would give you access to a much greater set of Open MPI features (i.e., significantly fewer restrictions).<br>
<br>
As for why your machine cannot connect to itself using its own IP addresses, that's a bit odd. It suggests that you have some kind of blocking software in there somewhere. We probably don't have enough Windows experience here in the community to help with that.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps!<br>

&gt; Being relatively new to MPI, I was not aware 'sm' did not work with intercommunicators - I had assumed it was an option if the others were not available.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I am running as an admin on this test machine. When adding the option '-mca btl_tcp_port_min_v4 2000', a higher port number is used, but that does not alter the program behavior at all.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Given that the initial development was on Linux using OpenMpi v1.5, I would like to assume the Windows implementation would have mostly equivalent feature development, and then improved in v1.6. Apparently that isn't true...<br>
&gt; This is rather disappointing that a seemingly basic MPI communication functionality is broken like this under Windows, even if it is an older version.<br>
&gt; Hacking on the Windows OpenMPI code is a rabbit hole that I do not want to go down for numerous reasons.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I have briefly explored alternate Windows MPI libraries: the Windows version of MPICH (from Microsoft) has not implemented MPI_Comm_Spawn; Intel MPI has a licensing fee. Do you any other alternatives to suggest?<br>

&gt; the sm btl does not work with inter communicators and hence disqualifies itself.<br>
&gt; i guess this is what you interpreted as 'partially working'<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; i am surprised you are using a privileged port (260 &lt; 1024), are you running as an admin ?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; Open MPI is no more supported on windows, and the 1.6 series is pretty antique these days...<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; regardless this, the source code points to<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; static __inline int opal_get_socket_errno(void) {<br>
&gt; int ret = WSAGetLastError();<br>
&gt; switch (ret) {<br>

&gt; ...<br>
&gt; default: printf(&quot;Feature not implemented: %d %s\n&quot;, __LINE__, __FILE__); return OPAL_ERROR;<br>
&gt; };<br>
&gt; }<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; at first, it is worth printing (ret) if the feature is not implemented.<br>
&gt; then you can hack this part and add the missing case<br>
&gt; recent windows (7) might use a newer one that was not available on older ones (xp)<br>

&gt;&gt; All of these test runs have the same behavior when performed with and without the firewall active.<br>
&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt; The fact that the executor programs don't get past the MPI_Init call when the 'sm' is excluded from btl set , implies that the 'sm' is at least partially working.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt; Just looking at this output, it would appear that Windows is configured in a way that prevents the procs from connecting to each other via TCP while on the same node, and shared memory is disqualifying itself - which leaves no way for two procs on the same
 node to communicate.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have developed a set of C&#43;&#43; MPI programs for performing a series of scientific calculations. The master 'scheduler' program spawns off sets of parallelized 'executor' programs using the MPI_Comm_spawn routine; these executors communicate back and forth
 with the scheduler (only small amounts of information) via MPI_Bcast, MPI_Recv and MPI_Send routines (the 'C' library versions).<br>

 It all compiles and links properly under VS2012.<br>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; ================================================<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The addition of the mpirun option &quot;-mca btl_tcp_if_exclude none&quot; eliminates the benign 127.0.0.1 warning; the option &quot;-mca btl_base_verbose 100&quot; adds output that verifies that the tcp, sm and self btl modules are successfully initialized - nothing else
 seems to be amiss!<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have also tested this with the firewall completely disabled on the Windows machine, with no change in behavior.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have been unable to determine what the error codes indicate, and am puzzled why the behavior is different when using the 'mpirun' launcher.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I have attached the prototype scheduler and executor program source code files, as well as files containing the Windows installation ompi information.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please help me figure out what is needed to enable this MPI communication.<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks,<br>
